Title - Set the track
{Elucidating the problem}
The expection of this assignment was pretty straight foreward (only figuratively). We were asked to outline lane lines on the roads from the sample photographs taken from dashboard of the camera of a vehicle and from the walk-over bridges.
Configuration of lanes and challenging in images - 
Blurring the broken lane lines to make it appear as one Hough line but blurring make them difficult to identify.

{Initial thoughts and how ingredients were sequentially stirred in}
Ingredients to the recipe - but initially the plan was to utilize only some of the ingredients, as only few appeared to be necessary. 
Different approaches and limitation of each approach (with an example) -
0. Extract lanes using colors (white predominantly) - 

1. Region of Interest -
    a. Considering only half of the image (split)
    b. Taking elliptical shape with bottom axis as a major axis
    c. 

{Throretical understanding of Hough transform}
{Link to skip to the next section}
Hough transform and theoretical description about it - 
Sometimes, opposite road divider is made of concrete as well, and of similar color as lanes. Different continents.

Slope consideration for horizontal signs on the images
